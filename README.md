## Technology Stack

Here's a breakdown of the technologies used in this project:

- **[Backend Framework]:**
  - _Example 1: Django (Python)_: A high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of clean, pragmatic RESTful APIs and web applications. It provides features for routing, database management (ORM), and security.
  - _Example 2: Node.js with Express.js_: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server. Express.js is a minimalist web framework for Node.js, used for building robust and scalable APIs.
  - _Example 3: Ruby on Rails_: A full-stack framework written in Ruby, providing structure for database-backed web applications. It emphasizes convention over configuration.
- **[Database]:**
  - _Example 1: PostgreSQL_: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system (ORDBMS) known for its reliability, feature robustness, and performance.
  - _Example 2: MySQL_: A popular open-source relational database management system (RDBMS), widely used for web applications.
  - _Example 3: MongoDB_: A cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.
- **[API Style]:**
  - _Example: RESTful API_: An architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources.
- **[Frontend (If Applicable)]:**
  - _Example 1: React_: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows for creating dynamic and interactive web applications.
  - _Example 2: HTML, CSS, JavaScript_: The core technologies for building web pages. HTML provides the structure, CSS the styling, and JavaScript the interactivity.
- **[Other Technologies]:**
  - _Example 1: Docker_: A platform for containerizing applications, enabling consistent deployment across different environments.
  - _Example 2: Git_: A distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.
  - _Example 3: GraphQL_: A query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data.
